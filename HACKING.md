# Hacking Hold

* Get your local environment set up for hold's dependencies. The
  quickest way to do this is to copy Gemfile.local.example to Gemfile.local,
  but if you're hacking on the gems declared in that file you may well want to
  modify it.

* Bundle exec rake test to check that everything is working.
